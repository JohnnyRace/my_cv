### About me

  My main goal is to become a highly qualified IT specialist. My strong point is the backend.
I have no production experience, but I worked with bots for telegrams, instragram and VKontakte
with Python. Now I am developing pet-projects and working on practice. I use Linux on a daily
basis for development, especially Manjaro. I can also work in Ubuntu. Now I am learning very
quickly because I want to start working in my field. Of course, I really love to learn new things!
